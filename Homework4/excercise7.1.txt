Method
------
I defined a function to give reverse complement of the sequence. To import the
sequence file from the command line I used import sys and sys.argv. To get the
sequence from the file I used open and read. I used strip method to remove extra
spaces and split by new line to creat an input_seq list. Then by using for loop
I created another list (c_list) by breaking the words in the input_seq list using
split and gave space as a delimiter. Then I used the reverse comp function on
the firt two items of the c_list to get the reverse complement in the desired
format.

Strength & Weakness
-------------------
This code works for any file with sequences in the same format as the one that was
mentioned in the example lec7 ppt. This won't work if the sequences are seperated by
any delimiter other than space.
