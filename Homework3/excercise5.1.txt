Method
------
I choose TP53 gene pcr primers as input sequence from the primer bank. It showed that
the gene has 3 sets of primers, I added them in the comment to check the working of
the code. I defined complement function to give the complement of nucleotide in
a sequence and then defined another function, reverse_comp, included for loop and
called the complement function in the reverse_comp function. As the loop goes on
each nucleotide is converted into it's complement and stored in newseq. When the
loop runs again the complement of the next nucleotide is added before the previous
complement. This gives the reverse complement of the primers.

Strength & Weakness
-------------------
This code can handle upper and lower case inputs. I did not consider the case where other
string charecters like 'N' being in the input as the inputs I choose do not have
those. This can be rectified by adding an additional else statement in the
complement function.
