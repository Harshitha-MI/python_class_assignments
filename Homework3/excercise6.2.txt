Method
------
I used import sys, sys.stdin.read and sys.argv[1] to get the input_seq file and the
command to manipulate the sequence from the command line, respectively.To manipulate
the input I used if statement and for loop to get complement, reverse and reverse
complement. If the command is complement the code using the defined function gives
the complement of the input. In cas of reverse, the code goes in loop, reads the
nucleotide and keeps adding nucleotide before the previous one as the loop goes on.

Strength & Weakness
-------------------
The code can handle lower and upper case inputs. When reverse complement is given on
the command line as a command, the code for reverse is processed and reverse of
the sequence is generated. To get the reverse complement the user has to give the
command without any spaces between reverse and complement(reversecomplement).
