I created two variables, one for the dna sequence and the other for the desired codon.
To find the index of the codon from the dna sequence I used .find method and in the
print statment I added 1 to the index to get the actual position of the codon.
To find the translation frame I used the modulus operator as the frame is
in cycles of three.This code works to find the translation frame of 1 and 2 but not
the third frame as this code returns zero as the translation frame.
I think I could use an If statement to correct the code but I'm not sure.
