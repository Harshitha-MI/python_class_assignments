Method
------
I used the same code to get the reverse complement of the primer sequence. To check
if the primer is a reverse complement palindrome I used if statement. The code
counts the chunk length of the primer which is length of primer (floor divided)// 2.
This gives us the exact half the length of the primer. If the primer has odd number
of charecters, as I used floor division, it gives an integer number. After getting
the length of the chunck. I break the primer sequence to first and second parts by
giving appropriate index in [] to get equal half, in case of even length primer. In
case of odd length primer, I left the middle nucleotide and assigned first and second
parts of the primer. Then I check if the first part of theprimer is the reverse
complement plaindrome using reverse _comp function on second part.

Strength & Weakness
-------------------
This code considers a primer is a reverse complement palindrome if the first half
of the sequence is equal to the second half's reverse complement. But a primer can
form a reverse complement primer with any set of nucleotides of the primer sequence
not just half of the sequence. For example, the last three or four nucleotides of
the primer sequence can form a reverse complement palindrome. This code does not
work in that way.
