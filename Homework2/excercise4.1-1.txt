Method
------
I defined a function, complement, by adding if and elif statement to convert the
codon to its complement version. Then I assigned variables like first, second and
third with the opposite index as values. Then I called the function complement in
the reverse variable to get the reverse complement of the codon.

Strength and Weakness
---------------------
This code works for codons with u, any letter, upper case and lower case values.The
weakness of this code would be that it is too wordy.
