Method
------
I split apart the tandem and assging them to codon variable. Then I used count method
to find the number of repetitions. Then I used if statement to determin if the sequence has a perfect 
number of tandem repeats or not.

Strength and weakness
---------------------
While this code works to find the number of tandem repeats it fails to go over a sequence and find the
tandem repeats.
