Method
------
To get the input from the command line, I used import sys and sys.argv.I wrote two
sys.argv commands, so that it reads first and second inputs on the command line as
the two input primers.

Strength & Weakness
-------------------
This code can handle lower an upper case inputs and gives the output, reverse
complement of primer, in upper case. The command line input makes it easier to use
the same command by simply pressing the up arrow key.Using this method I can input
mutltiple inputs by adding an sys.argv statement with different positions.The
command line input does not give a prompt like the input function.
