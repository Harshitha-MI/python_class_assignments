Method
------
I used import sys to input the DNA sequence file from the command line. I created a dictionary with nucleotides as keys and their frequencies as values using for loop and count method. Then I used sorted function with key lambda to sort the items in the dictionary base on the value in the dictionary. Then I use reversed function to get the most occurance to least occurance and convert it into a list usinglist function. 

Strength and Weakness
---------------------
This is a compact code that avoids writing multiple lines of code with for loops and if statments and defining a function separately.
